Creating/editing tools
===

In cryoHub, all the available tools (commands) can be found in the ``command runner`` section: [image]

In the file system, they are controlled by the yaml files in the directory
``cryohub-react/cryohub/commands/``.

By simply adding a new yaml file written for your own tool in this folder,
cryoHub will generate a corresponding GUI for you. You can also edit the existing
yaml files so that it suits your needs better.

Here is a snippet of an example yaml file::
