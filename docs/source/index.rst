Welcome to cryoHub's documentation!
===================================

.. note::

   This documentation explains how to add your own tools to cryoHub with config files
   and how to customize visualization displays for the tools.
   This is not a documentation of the cryoHub software source code.
   If you are interested in learning more about the software source code itself,
   feel free to contact me at yilai@umich.edu.

cryoHub is a software that provides a user-friendly web interface for the existing
command line-based tools with an easy user, project and job management. Orginally
designed for cryo-EM data processing, cryoHub can actually be easily extended to other
fields.

For method developers, cryoHub works as an "engine" to enable a web-based GUI for
your command line-based tools with minimum efforts.
This documentation will explain how to install cryoHub, add your own tools
or edit existing tools, and use the existing visualization widgets for your tools.
